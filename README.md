# Retries

Retries is a gem that provides a class method, `Retries.run`,
to evaluate a block with randomized, truncated, exponential backoff.

There are similar projects out there
(see [retry_block](https://github.com/afazio/retry_block) and
[retry_this](https://bitbucket.org/amanking/retry_this/wiki/Home), for example)
but these will require you to implement the backoff scheme yourself.
If you don't need randomized exponential backoff,
you should check out those gems.

## Installation

You can get the gem with `gem install retries`
or simply add `gem 'retries'` to your `Gemfile`
if you're using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).

## Usage

Suppose we have some task we are trying to perform: `do_the_thing`.
This might be a call to a third-party API or a flaky service.
Here's how you can try it three times before failing:

```ruby
require 'retries'
Retries.run(max_tries: 3) { do_the_thing }
```

The block is passed a single parameter, `attempt_number`,
which is the number of attempts that have been made (starting at 1):

```ruby
Retries.run(max_tries: 3) do |attempt_number|
  puts "Trying to do the thing: attempt #{attempt_number}"
  do_the_thing
end
```

### Custom exceptions

By default `Retries.run` rescues instances of `StandardError`.
You'll likely want to make this more specific to your use case.
You may provide an exception class or an array of classes:

```ruby
Retries.run(max_tries: 3, rescue: RestClient::Exception) { do_the_thing }
Retries.run(
  max_tries: 3, rescue: [RestClient::Unauthorized, RestClient::RequestFailed]
) do
  do_the_thing
end
```

### Handlers

`Retries.run` allows you to pass a custom handler
that will be called each time before the block is retried.
The handler will be called with three arguments:
`exception` (the rescued exception),
`attempt_number` (the number of attempts that have been made thus far),
and `total_delay` (the number of seconds since the start of the time
the block was first attempted, including all retries).

```ruby
handler = proc do |exception, attempt_number, total_delay|
  puts "Handler saw a #{exception.class}; retry attempt #{attempt_number};" \
       " #{total_delay} seconds have passed."
end

Retries.run(
  max_tries: 5, handler: handler, rescue: [RuntimeError, ZeroDivisionError]
) do |attempt|
  (1 / 0) if attempt == 3
  raise 'hey!' if attempt < 5
end
```

This will print something like:

```
Handler saw a RuntimeError; retry attempt 1; 2.9e-05 seconds have passed.
Handler saw a RuntimeError; retry attempt 2; 0.501176 seconds have passed.
Handler saw a ZeroDivisionError; retry attempt 3; 1.129921 seconds have passed.
Handler saw a RuntimeError; retry attempt 4; 1.886828 seconds have passed.
```

### Delay parameters

By default, `Retries.run` will wait about a half second between the first
and second attempts, and then the delay time will increase exponentially
between attempts (but stay at no more than 1 second).
The delays are perturbed randomly. You can control the parameters
via the two options `:base_sleep_seconds` and `:max_sleep_seconds`.
For instance, you can start the delay at 100 ms
and go up to a maximum of about 2 seconds:

```ruby
Retries.run(
  max_tries: 10, :base_sleep_seconds => 0.1, max_sleep_seconds: 2.0
) { do_the_thing }
```

### Global configuration

You can configure Retries globally:

```ruby
Retries.options.merge! max_tries: 50, max_sleep_seconds: 15
```

But be careful! It can affect foreign code, for example, in required gems.

### Testing

In tests, you may wish to test that retries are being performed
without any delay for sleeping:

```ruby
Retries.options[:sleep_enabled] = false
Retries.run(max_tries: 100) { raise 'Boo!' } # Now this fails fast
```

Of course, this will mask any errors to the `:base_sleep_seconds`
and `:max_sleep_seconds` parameters, so use with caution.
